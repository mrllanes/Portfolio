I am the President and Co-Owner of Senall Sabres, LLC., an energy land services company based out of the North Houston area.  I have been a land professional for 15+ years with field and inhouse experience. I have also been an Information Technology professional since 1992.  My wife and I founded Senall Sabres in 2009, a full land services company providing clients with a variety of land needs, including, but not limited to, mineral ownership, leasing, due diligence (field and in-house), acquisition/divestiture, and much more.</p>

                <p><strong>Respect. Loyalty. Professionalism. Determination. Patience.</strong> These are all characteristics that Michael Llanes believes are necessary for a successful career. Respect for those above you and respect for those below you. No one is better than you and no one deserves to be treated poorly. You may be their boss today and in five years, they may be offering you a job. Always show respect to everyone. Loyalty to your company, your teammates and your clients. Leaving a company for a few bucks more a day is not always a good thing. They will remember, especially when you realize you made a mistake and try to come back. Stick up for your teammates and they will have your back. Your clients will remember the things you did for them and will keep you around because you do good work for them and recommend them to others. Always carry yourself in a dignified, professional manner. You represent yourself and your company at all times. Work and behave in a way that others will believe you to be reliable, competent, mature and respectful. Work can be tough and things do not always go your way, be persistent with your solutions. Be determined to find answers, to improve yourself and not leave others disappointed in your efforts. Be commited to all that you do. Not everyone knows what you know, and you do not know everything that others know. Show patience to others, this above other things will be most appreciated by those needing your help.</p>
                <p>These characteristics should be seen in you as much as in those surrounding you. When you see that, you know you are in the right place.</p>

                <h1>An Introduction to Your Key Asset</h1>
                    <p>Michael Llanes graduated from Our Lady of the Lake University with a Bachelor of Arts. He started his career in the technology industry, well before graduating from college, as computers were fascinating and improving at an alarming rate. Michael learned all aspects of computer hardware and worked at several companies as desktop support, team trainer, asset manager, business analyst, systems support and network engineer. Starting at level one support and rising to team supervisor, IT manager and even Director of Information Technology over the course of several years.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the year 2000, Michael decided to take his knack for training others, and his love of technology, and decided to get a teaching certifcate to teach high school students. This is also the time that Michael earned his CCNA certification. With these, he taught the CCNA curriculem at the Cisco Networking Acedemy located on the Wunsche Career Campus in Spring ISD. As he was taking the CCNA courses himself, he caught the eye of the instructors and was asked to also teach at the Cisco Networking Academy located at the Tomball College campus (now known as Lone Star College-Tomball). As the Tomball academy was considered the Regional Academy, it is the only place where instructors teach other people how to be instructors. Michael taught the Cisco CCNA classes to both high school students (during the day) and college student (at night) for several years before transitioning into the energy sector.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although teaching was extremely enjoyable, in 2005 Michael became a landman. A landman, as defined by the AAPL: "A landman is the public facing side of an oil, gas and mineral exploration and production team. A professional landman interacts and negotiates directly with landowners to acquire oil and gas drilling leases on behalf of oil and gas companies." If you are unfamiliar with a landman, you can learn more about this profession <a href="https://www.landman.org/about/who-we-are/what-is-a-landman" target="_blank">here.</a> Michael's technological knowledge and his knack for training/teaching others has been a great asset in this industry. He has worked independantly, as part of a team, training new landmen, as assistant crew chief and team lead. Early on, Michael and his wife created Senall Sabres, LLC., and have been working through their company for several clients throughout the years. Working both in the field and in-house, Michael has made several contacts in the industry and has been very fortunate to continue working through all the downturns during his time in oil and gas.</p>

                    <p>This portfolio site was created by Michael with the skills he learned through the Rice University Full Stack Coding program under one of the most knowledgeable instructors available today. Combining his management skills with his overall technological knowledge and adding full stack development skills to the mix, Michael Llanes is ready to help take your company to the next level.</p>
                    
                    <p>Michael Llanes is married to Michelle Frederick Llanes (since 1998). They live in the Lake Conroe area, which is to the far North of Houston, Texas. They have three wonderful children: Elisa, a senior in high school, Michael, a sophmore in high school, and Sophia, who is in eight grade. Michael and his family enjoy traveling to any place that catches their attention (this is usually spearheaded by Michelle). Michael also enjoys all things computer/technology related, sports (football, basketball, soccer), desktop RPGs and other games. He also takes extreme pleasure in riding his <a href="https://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/honda-rune-1800cc-six-cylinder-motorcycle-road-test/" target="_blank">Honda Rune</a> whenever possible. Music and movies are also a big part of his life.</p>
